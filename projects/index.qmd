## PROJECT 1: Integrative Spatial-scRNA-seq Atlas of Immunotherapy Resistance Mechanisms Across Cancer Types

### Research Question
How do spatial organization and cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment drive immunotherapy resistance across different cancer types, and can we identify universal versus cancer-specific resistance mechanisms?

### Hypothesis
Immunotherapy resistance is mediated by spatially-organized cellular niches that exhibit both pan-cancer commonalities and cancer-specific features. These resistance niches can be identified by integrating single-cell transcriptomics with spatial localization data, revealing targetable vulnerabilities.

### Literature Review & Research Gap

#### Current State
Recent studies have shown that scRNA-seq technologies analyze tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment, with growing interest in applying findings to clinical settings for improving cancer diagnostics and predicting immunotherapy responses. Multiple studies have examined immune checkpoint blockade responses using scRNA-seq, but most are limited in sample size and require advanced coding skills for exploration.

Spatial multi-omics technologies have revealed that relative positions and interactions of cell types in the tumor microenvironment strongly influence tumor development, though current commercialized platforms do not provide true single-cell level resolution. Research on prostate cancer has shown that SPP1-expressing macrophages mediate immunotherapeutic resistance through adenosine pathway activation.

#### Research Gap
1. **Lack of pan-cancer spatial analysis**: Most studies focus on single cancer types
2. **Missing integration**: Spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq are rarely integrated comprehensively
3. **Resistance evolution**: Temporal dynamics of resistance mechanisms are poorly understood
4. **3D spatial architecture**: Most spatial transcriptomics remains limited to 2D tissue sections

## PROJECT 2: Metabolic Reprogramming Dynamics During Cancer Progression and Therapy Resistance

### Research Question
How does metabolic reprogramming evolve during cancer progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance, and can we identify metabolic vulnerabilities that are targetable across different disease stages?

### Hypothesis
Cancer cells undergo stage-specific metabolic reprogramming, with distinct metabolic profiles characterizing primary tumors, metastases, and resistant disease. These metabolic shifts create therapeutic vulnerabilities that differ from primary tumors.

### Literature Review & Research Gap

#### Current State
Recent scRNA-seq studies have revealed metabolic heterogeneity in cancer, showing that metabolic reprogramming extends beyond tumor cells to diverse cell types within the tumor microenvironment. In colorectal cancer liver metastasis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is upregulated and associated with TGFβ signaling pathway activation.

Studies in small cell lung cancer have shown that metabolic reprogramming serves as an upstream regulator of immune evasion, though research on metabolic reprogramming in aggressive cancers remains limited. Previous studies have primarily focused on specific cell types or cancer types with low-throughput methods.

#### Research Gap
1. **Temporal dynamics**: How metabolism changes during disease progression is poorly understood
2. **Cell-state specific**: Metabolic heterogeneity within tumor cell populations
3. **Cross-cancer comparison**: Limited pan-cancer metabolic analysis
4. **Therapy-induced changes**: Metabolic adaptation to treatment pressure
