## Why Single-Cell?

Bulk RNA sequencing measures gene expression averaged across thousands of cells, masking the diversity within complex tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) overcomes this limitation by profiling transcriptomes at individual-cell resolution, enabling the discovery of rare cell types, transitional states, and cell-type-specific responses to perturbation.

## Key Steps in a Typical scRNA-seq Workflow

1. **Tissue dissociation & cell capture** — Droplet-based platforms (10x Genomics Chromium) or plate-based methods (Smart-seq2/3).
2. **Library preparation & sequencing** — cDNA synthesis, amplification, and Illumina sequencing.
3. **Raw data processing** — Demultiplexing, alignment (STARsolo, Cell Ranger), and count matrix generation.
4. **Quality control** — Filtering low-quality cells based on mitochondrial content, gene counts, and doublet detection.
5. **Downstream analysis** — Normalization, dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP), clustering, differential expression, and trajectory inference.

## Tools of the Trade

The **scverse** ecosystem — including **Scanpy**, **AnnData**, **scvi-tools**, and **Muon** — provides a comprehensive Python framework for single-cell analysis. R users often rely on **Seurat** and **Bioconductor** packages.

## Looking Ahead

Stay tuned for deeper dives into specific applications: microglial profiling in neurodegeneration, spatial transcriptomics in the tumor microenvironment, and multi-modal single-cell approaches.
