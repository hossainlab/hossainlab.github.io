## Why Space Matters

Standard scRNA-seq dissociates tissues, losing spatial context. Spatial transcriptomics technologies preserve the physical location of gene expression, revealing how cells communicate within their native tissue architecture.

## Technology Landscape

| Platform | Resolution | Approach |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 10x Visium | ~55 µm spots | Capture-based |
| MERFISH | Subcellular | Imaging-based |
| Slide-seq | ~10 µm beads | Capture-based |
| CODEX | Single-cell (protein) | Imaging-based |

## Applications in Cancer

- **Tumor-immune interface mapping** — Identifying spatial patterns of immune infiltration and exclusion
- **Tertiary lymphoid structures** — Characterizing organized immune aggregates associated with immunotherapy response
- **Invasion fronts** — Transcriptional programs at the leading edge of tumor expansion
- **Cell-cell communication** — Ligand-receptor analysis with spatial constraints

## Computational Challenges

Spatial data require specialized tools: **Squidpy** for spatial statistics, **cell2location** and **DestVI** for deconvolution, and **NICHE-NET** for spatially-aware cell communication inference.

## Outlook

As spatial technologies achieve higher resolution and multiplexing, they will become essential for understanding treatment resistance and designing combination therapies.
