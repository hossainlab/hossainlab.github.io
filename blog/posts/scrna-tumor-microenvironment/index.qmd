## The Tumor Microenvironment (TME)

Tumors are not just masses of malignant cells — they are complex ecosystems comprising cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix. The composition and state of this **tumor microenvironment (TME)** profoundly influences disease progression and treatment response.

## What scRNA-seq Reveals

Single-cell profiling of the TME has uncovered:

### Immune Compartment
- **CD8+ T cell exhaustion gradients** — Progressive loss of effector function marked by *TOX*, *LAG3*, and *PDCD1* expression
- **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)** — Immunosuppressive populations enriched in the tumor core
- **Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)** — Polarization along a spectrum from M1-like (anti-tumor) to M2-like (pro-tumor)

### Stromal Compartment
- **Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)** — Multiple subtypes with distinct roles in immune exclusion, matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis
- **Endothelial heterogeneity** — Tumor vasculature with abnormal transcriptional programs

## Clinical Implications

Understanding TME composition at single-cell resolution enables:

- **Biomarker discovery** for immunotherapy response prediction
- **Rational combination therapy** design targeting multiple TME components
- **Patient stratification** based on immune cell states rather than bulk signatures

## Key Resources

- Comprehensive human tumor atlases (e.g., HTAN, Tabula Sapiens)
- Pan-cancer single-cell studies providing cross-tumor-type insights
