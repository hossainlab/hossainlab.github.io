## Microglia: The Brain's Immune Sentinels

Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, constantly surveying the brain parenchyma for damage and pathogens. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia adopt a range of activation states that can be both neuroprotective and neurotoxic.

## Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM)

Single-cell RNA-seq studies in AD mouse models and human post-mortem tissue have identified a conserved transcriptional program termed **disease-associated microglia (DAM)**. Key features include:

- Downregulation of homeostatic genes (*P2ry12*, *Cx3cr1*, *Tmem119*)
- Upregulation of lipid metabolism and phagocytosis genes (*Apoe*, *Lpl*, *Trem2*)
- A TREM2-dependent transition from stage 1 to stage 2 DAM

## Beyond the DAM Binary

Recent high-resolution atlases have expanded the picture beyond a simple homeostatic-vs-DAM dichotomy, revealing:

- **Interferon-responsive microglia** enriched near amyloid plaques
- **Proliferating microglia** associated with disease progression
- **Lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia (LDAM)** linked to aging

## Implications for Therapeutics

Understanding microglial heterogeneity is critical for designing targeted therapies. TREM2 agonists, for example, aim to enhance protective DAM responses while minimizing pro-inflammatory signaling.
