# Research Statement 
My research focuses on developing reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for large-scale bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data to uncover molecular biomarkers, immunological signatures, and therapeutic targets in cancer and neurological diseases. By integrating multi-omics data analysis, machine learning, and biology, I aim to advance computational methods that bridge biological discovery and clinical translation.
