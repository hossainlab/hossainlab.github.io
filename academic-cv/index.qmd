### **Experience**
**PhD -- Remote Sensing in Forestry** [*May 2019 --- May 2024*]{.cvdate} <br> UBC (Faculty of Forest Resources Management) [*Vancouver (CA)*]{.cvloc}

-   Explored the capabilities, limitations, and opportunities of drone-based remote sensing in assessing ecosystem recovery, with a specific focus on digital aerial photogrammetry and vegetation.
-   Worked in a top-tier, highly productive lab environment where I collaborated with other students and scientists, participated in various field sampling campaigns, and attended seminars.

**Teaching Assistant** [*June 2019 --- November 2022*]{.cvdate} <br> UBC (Faculty of Forest Resources Management) [*Vancouver (CA)*]{.cvloc}

-  Developed course materials, supported students with exercises, and facilitated research projects involving geospatial information in the following courses: Data Science in Forest Resources (FRST 505), Geospatial Data Analysis with Python (GEM 530), Observing the Earth from Space (CONS 127), and Project Proposal Development and Proof of Concept (FCOR 599).

**Research Intern** [*September 2018 --- March 2019*]{.cvdate} <br> UBC (Faculty of Forest Resources Management) [*Vancouver (CA)*]{.cvloc}
